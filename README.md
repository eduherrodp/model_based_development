## Duck Simulator  

This is a simple simulator of a duck. It has a quack behavior and a fly behavior. The quack behavior can be changed to mute quack or squeak. The fly behavior can be changed to fly with wings or fly with rocket.

## Store 

This is a program that simulates a store. It has a list of products and a list of clients. The clients can buy products and the store can sell products.

## Weather Station

This is a program that simulates a weather station. It has a list of sensors and a list of displays. The displays can be changed to show the temperature, humidity or pressure.
